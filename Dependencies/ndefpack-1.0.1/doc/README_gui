1. Intro
--------

ndefgui is a small utility for dealing with EasyFlash .crt images.
It's the pointy-clicky version of ndeft.

ndefgui is GPL, see COPYING. Some bits taken from VICE(minus).
ndefgui uses FLTK. To satisfy the license:
           ndefgui is based in part on the work of
           the FLTK project (http://www.fltk.org).

For more info on EasyFlash, see:

The Mac OS X specific components and the .app wrapper is
written by ALeX Kazik (see AUTHORS).


2. Usage
--------


2.1. Starting
-------------

ndefgui can be started by simply doing:
    ndefgui
...or via the usual UI means.

To load a .crt image at start, do:
    ndefgui my_cart.crt


2.2. Using
----------

Most operations should be fairly obvious, albeit clunky.

The 'H' and 'A' in the contents box refer to "hidden" and "64k alignment",
respectively.

To set the EF-Name, select the first line of the contents box ("# H A Name...")
and click the Ren button or use Image->Rename item.

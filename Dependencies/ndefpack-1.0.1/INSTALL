1. Requirements
---------------

You'll need the usual toolchain (make, GCC, ...).

ndeft just needs a C compiler.

ndefgui needs a C++ compiler and FLTK v1.1.x / v1.3.x:
http://www.fltk.org/

If FLTK (or a C++ compiler) is not found, ndefgui is not built.
Use --without-gui to disable.

The EasyLoader and EAPI firmware need PHP and the cross assembler ACME:
http://www.esw-heim.tu-clausthal.de/~marco/smorbrod/acme/

Note: neither ACME nor PHP is not required for building the tools.
If ACME or PHP is not found, the firmware is not built; prebuilt .prg files are
distributed with the source code package in order to avoid this dependency.

Note: building the firmware from outside the source tree is currently broken.
This means that "mkdir build && cd build && ../configure && make" will fail
if the firmware files are touched.

Use --without-firmware to disable firmware building.


2. Building
-----------

A simple
    ./configure && make
...should build everything.

You can try
    ./configure --host=mingw32 && make
...to cross compile for win32, but likely it won't be that easy.


3. Installing
-------------

On *nix-ish systems, a
    make install
...should do it.

On win32, just copy the .exes in src/ whereever you want. You can also use
    make bindist
...to build a handy .zip, but this needs "unix2dos" and possibly other
tools in order to work.

On Mac OS X systems, a
    make bindist
...builds a handy .zip file with a ndefgui.app and ndeft (cli) inside.
